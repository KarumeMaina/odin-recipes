    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Moussaka is a layered oven casserole dish made with vegetables and meat. <br>
    The most well-known version of moussaka is made with layers of eggplant slices, <br>
    cheese, and a meat sauce, topped with a thick béchamel sauce; however, other <br>
    favorites call for potatoes, zucchini, or a combination of vegetables. More recently, <br>
    a meatless (vegetarian) version has also become widely available.</p>

<p>Until the early 1900s, moussaka was a more simple dish, using just vegetables and <br>
meats. The addition of béchamel sauce is attributed to Nikos Tselementes, a Greek <br>
chef who trained in France, and this newer version quickly became a favorite in <br>
Greece.</p>
