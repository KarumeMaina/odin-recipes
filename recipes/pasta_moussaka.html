    <h1>Pasta Moussaka Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../images/pasta.png" alt="Pasta Moussaka/ Greek Lasagna">
    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Moussaka is a layered oven casserole dish made with vegetables and meat. <br>
    The most well-known version of moussaka is made with layers of eggplant slices, <br>
    cheese, and a meat sauce, topped with a thick béchamel sauce; however, other <br>
    favorites call for potatoes, zucchini, or a combination of vegetables. More recently, <br>
    a meatless (vegetarian) version has also become widely available.</p>
    
    <p>Until the early 1900s, moussaka was a more simple dish, using just vegetables and <br>
        meats. The addition of béchamel sauce is attributed to Nikos Tselementes, a Greek <br>
        chef who trained in France, and this newer version quickly became a favorite in <br>
        Greece.</p>

    <li>1 lb. lean ground beef (90% or above)</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 tsp. ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>1 tsp. paprika</li>
    <li>2 tsp. dried oregano</li>

<li>1/3 c. all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1/4 c. freshly grated Parmesan</li>
<li>Pinch freshly grated nutmeg</li>
<li>Kosher salt</li>
<li>2 egg yolks</li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <li>Make the meat sauce: Grease a 9"-x-13" <br>
        baking dish with cooking spray or butter and set aside. <br>
        In a heavy-bottomed Dutch oven, heat oil over medium heat. <br>
        Add onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 5 minutes. <br>
        Add ground beef and cook, stirring occasionally, until beginning to brown, 3 to 5 minutes.</li><br>

    <li>Reduce heat to medium-low. Add garlic and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute more.<br>
         Add cinnamon, paprika, oregano, and bay leaf and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li><br>

    <li>Add tomatoes with their juices, 1 teaspoon salt, and sugar and stir to combine. <br>
        Add eggplant and wine, stir well, and cover partially. Return to a simmer and cook, <br>
        stirring occasionally, until eggplant is tender and excess liquid has evaporated, about 30 minutes. <br>
        Remove from heat.</li><br>

    <li>Meanwhile, in a large pot of boiling salted water, cook pasta for half the time on the package directions. <br>
        Drain. Add cooked pasta to meat sauce, stirring to fully coat noodles. <br>
        Position a rack in the top third of the oven and preheat to 375º.</li><br>
    
    <li>Make the béchamel: In a small <br>
        saucepan over low heat, warm milk.</li><br>
    
    <li>In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt butter, sprinkle in flour, and whisk until smooth.<br>
        Cook until it slightly darkens and smells nutty, 2 to 3 minutes.</li><br>

    <li>Very slowly pour warmed milk into butter mixture,<br>
        continuously whisking until it is smooth and thickened to a custard-like consistency, about 5 minutes.</li><br>

    <li>Remove from heat and stir in Parmesan and nutmeg. Season with salt. <br>
        Let cool slightly, then whisk in egg yolks.</li><br>

    <li>Assemble the pasta: Transfer pasta mixture to prepared baking dish and spread into an even layer. <br>
        Using a rubber spatula, spread béchamel evenly over pasta, all the way to the edges. <br>
        Sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan on top.</li><br>

    <li>Grease underside of foil with cooking spray and cover dish loosely. Bake for 20 minutes.</li><br>

    <li>Increase heat to 400º, remove foil, and bake 15 to 20 minutes more, or until evenly browned.</li><br>
