    <h1>A French75 Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../images/french75.png" alt="French-75">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>French 75 is a cocktail made from gin, champagne, lemon juice, and sugar. <br>
        It is also called a 75 Cocktail, or in French simply a Soixante Quinze (Seventy Five).</p>

        <p>The drink dates to World War I, and an early form was created in 1915 at the <br>
            New York Bar in Paris—later Harry's New York Bar—by barman Harry MacElhone.<br>
             The combination was said to have such a kick that it felt like being shelled with the powerful French 75mm field gun.</p><br>
