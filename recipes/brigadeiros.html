    <h1>Brigadeiros Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../images/Brigadeiros.png" alt="Brigadeiros">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Brigadeiro is a simple Brazilian chocolate bonbon, created in the 1940s and <br>
        named after Brigadier Eduardo Gomes, whose shape is reminiscent of that of <br>
        some varieties of chocolate truffles. It is a very popular candy in Brazil and in <br>
        Portugal and it is usually served at birthday parties,and also as dessert. The <br>
        candy is made by mixing sweetened condensed milk, butter and chocolate powder together. <br></p>

        <p> The mixture is then heated in a pan on the stove or in a microwave oven to obtain a smooth, <br>
        sticky texture. It is usually rolled into balls which are covered in granulated chocolate; <br>
        that is the way brigadeiros are served at children's birthday parties. It can also be <br>
        consumed unrolled, with a spoon or used as a topping or filling for cakes, brownies and other <br>
        pastries. Beijinho is a variation that is often served together with brigadeiros at parties, <br>
        and is prepared with grated coconut instead of chocolate powder.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 can condensed milk</li>
            <li>1 tbsp. unsalted butter, plus more for greasing</li>
            <li>3 tbsp. unsweetened cocoa powder</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Combine the condensed milk, cocoa powder, <br>
            and 1 tbsp of butter in a medium saucepan. <br>
            Don’t worry if the butter doesn’t incorporate <br>
            well, it will once on the heat. Grease a plate <br>
            with extra butter, and set aside.</li><br>

        <li>Over a medium to low flame, heat the mixture <br>
                until thickened, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Stir <br>
                continuously so it doesn't burn. It if starts <br>
                to bubble, turn down the heat.</li><br>

        <li>When it starts to unstick from the bottom of<br>
                     the pan, pour the mixture onto your plate greased<br>
                      with butter. Spread it out using an offset spatula <br>
                      or the back of your spoon, and let sit until cool enough to handle.</li><br>
                
        <li>Spray a mini muffin tin with cooking spray. Add chocolate sprinkles onto<br>
             a plate or shallow bowl. Slightly grease your hands with butter. Spoon <br>
             about 1 tablespoon of mixture and roll into a ball between your hands. <br>
             (You can make these as big as you want, though about 3/4" in diameters traditional). <br>
             Roll the balls in the chocolate sprinkles to cover and place in the muffin tins. <br>
             Refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, about 90 minutes.</li><br>
